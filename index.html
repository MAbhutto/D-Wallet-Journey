        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>In todayâ€™s digital era, financial services have drastically evolved, with digital wallets emerging as a cornerstone of modern banking. Our project, "D-Wallet Journey," aims to delve deep into the realm of digital wallets, focusing on understanding user personas and multi-service usage patterns. By analyzing user behaviors related to various services offered for a wallet business, e.g. transfers, bill payments, mobile packages, and mobile recharges, we aim to uncover the intricate patterns and preferences that shape user experiences.</p>
        <h2>Novelty of the Project</h2>
        <p>"D-Wallet Journey" stands out due to its comprehensive and data-driven approach. We employ advanced analytical techniques such as Pareto analysis, multi-service usage patterns exploration, and user personas analysis to provide a holistic view of user interactions within the digital wallet ecosystem. Our project doesn't just analyze data; it transforms raw data into actionable insights, guiding businesses towards optimizing service offerings and enhancing customer experiences. The novelty lies in the integration of data sources and the creation of user-centric visualizations, offering a unified view of user behavior and preferences.</p>
